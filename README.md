# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied consistently across different browsers or environments. The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as a failure to apply Tailwind CSS classes to elements.  The classes appear to be correctly defined and included in the project, but in certain circumstances they are not rendered, resulting in unexpected styling.

## Reproduction Steps

The exact steps to reliably reproduce this issue are currently unknown. It seems to be related to environmental factors, browser inconsistencies, or potentially a conflict with other libraries.

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by employing a more robust approach to class application, ensuring that classes are consistently rendered.  This may involve using a different method to inject Tailwind CSS, or addressing potential conflicts with other styling libraries.
